# PlantAppv3
Finshed app for my raspberry pi plant watering project (using a solenoid valve and pneumatic tubing to water a series of plants)
which includes:
- manual watering
- scheduled watering
- control from anywhere in the world
- viewing water level with an image (Pi camera sends a photo to mobile app)
- view latest CPU temperature and check if the system is responsive
